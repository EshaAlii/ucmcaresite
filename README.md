# ucmcaresite
Worked with Gabriel Bermudaz Sellars, Alex Guzman, and Simone Achucarro on the UC Merced Caresite. 

Created a website that was intended to funciton in the same way as the official UC Merced Caresite. It was to serve as a new learning ground for front-end and back-end developement. Additionally it was also intended to teach us about user interaction with websites and data collection.
